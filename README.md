An F# template for FNA, ready to use out of the box. Credit to Remmah [for originally documenting this](https://gist.github.com/remmah/d7bcca26f46e799471d02395337c86ea).

# Need inspiration?

__Note:__ Most examples are older XNA games written in the early 2010's. That being said, FNA's integral compatibility and continuity with XNA should make this essentially irrelevant.

MonoGame examples not included as MonoGame diverges from FNA/XNA.
